"""
Core plugins registry for bundling and deterministic registration.

Purpose:
- Provide a single place to statically import core plugin classes so tools
  like PyInstaller can detect and bundle them.
- Return a list of core plugin classes for early registration.

Usage:
- Import your core plugin classes below and add them to CORE_PLUGINS.
- Being listed here is sufficient to treat a plugin as core (for registration and UI).
- Optionally set `is_core_plugin = True` on the class for clarity; not required.
